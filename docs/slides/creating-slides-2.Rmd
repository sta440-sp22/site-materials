### Software

- PowerPoint / Keynote (easy, WYSIWYG)
- LaTeX Beamer / R Markdown packages (clean, consistent, eventually straightforward)
- Random online things like Prezi (don't do this)

### `xaringan`

`xaringan` is an R package that lets users create clean HTML5 slides directly
in R Markdown. One benefit is that you can specify your own .css files for
formatting purposes. As well, since we're using R Markdown, we can directly
run R commands, allowing us to create fully reproducible slide decks.

Documentation is available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).

### `xaringan` examples

Some examples of slides created using the `xaringan` package in R Mardown are
those from STA 440! Links to the EM (1) lecture and spatial (3) lecture are
provided here:

### beamer

beamer is a LaTeX class that creates consistent, clean presentations. Like 
`xaringan`, it has a variety of built-in templates, but you can build your own
or specify options as well. 

There are ways of integrating beamer with R in 
order to create fully reproducible presentations (e.g., Sweave), but they're a
bit tougher to get started with. You will need a LaTeX installation on your
computer and some sort of editor -- I'm partial to TeXStudio as my LaTeX editor,
but others exist as well (e.g., TeXWorks, etc.).

The GitHub repo is available [here](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer), and
some helpful tutorials are available [here](https://math-linux.com/latex-26/article/how-to-make-a-presentation-with-latex-introduction-to-beamer)
and [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations).

### Today's activity

.question[
Once again, create a brief 5-slide deck regarding the DIG trial (feel free to
build off of the one you created last class) - try to have a complete product
by the end of class today, and create the deck in either `xaringan` in R 
Markdown or beamer using LaTeX if you are able to.
