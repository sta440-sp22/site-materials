### Survival data

In many studies, the outcome of interest is the amount of time from an initial 
observation until the occurrence of some event of interest.

Typically, the event of interest is called a .vocab[failure] (even if it's a 
good thing), and the associated time interval between a starting point and 
failure the .vocab[failure time], .vocab[survival time], or .vocab[event time].

### Digoxin

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = '70%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/digoxin.png")
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "left", out.width = '100%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/foxglove.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
- Foxgloves have been used in medicine for centuries
- Digoxin (the active ingredient) first isolated in 1930 
- Traditionally used for heart arrhythmia and heart failure
- One of the most prescribed drugs globally
]

---

### The DIG Trial

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '120%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dig_trial.png")
```

Investigators compared the **primary outcome** of the number of days from the
start of the study to either death or hospitalization from worsening heart
failure.

### The DIG Trial

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '120%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dig_trial.png")
```

.question[
How would ***you*** investigate this question, comparing the two treatment 
groups of digoxin vs. placebo?
]

---

### A naive analysis

Death or hospitalization due to worsening heart failure:

```{r}
dig %>% 
  select(ID, TRTMT, DWHF, DWHFDAYS) %>% 
  slice(1:10)
```

---

### A naive analysis

```{r}
dig %>% 
  filter(DWHF == 1) %>% 
  t.test(DWHFDAYS ~ TRTMT, data = .)
```

.question[
Are you convinced? What if we made some sort of regression model to account for
covariates? Would that be enough?
]

---

### A naive analysis


```{r}
dig %>% 
  count(TRTMT)
dig %>% 
  filter(DWHF == 1) %>% 
  count(TRTMT)
```

---

### Challenges

The unique nature of survival data is that typically not all units are observed
until their event times:
- Maybe a patient moved to Fiji and was lost to follow-up
- Maybe a patient never experienced the primary outcome at all because they got
hit by a bus
- Maybe the study was only funded to follow patients for two years after
enrollment

--

In these cases, observations are said to be .vocab[censored] - we know that 
they survived until at least their censoring time, but do not know any further
information.

Not accounting for censoring in an appropriate way leads to **biased** and/or
**inefficient** analyses.

### Representing survival data

See live visualization regarding .vocab[study time] vs. .vocab[patient time].

### Representing survival data

Underlying data:
- $T$: Failure time, a non-negative random variable
- $C$: Censoring time, a non-negative random variable
Observed data for individual $i$:
- $Y_i$: $(T_i \wedge C_i)$, the minimum of $T_i$ and $C_i$
- $\delta_i$: $1_{(T_i \le C_i)}$, whether we observe a failure

--

If $\delta_i = 0$, then we have .vocab[right-censoring]: the survival time is
longer than the censoring time.

Commonly, we assume $C_i$ are *i.i.d.* random variables with some distribution
and that the censoring mechanism is *independent* of the failure mechanism.

--

**Our goal is to make inferential statements about** $T$.

---

### Characterizing continuous $T$

- Density function: $f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t}$

- Distribution function: $F(t) = P(T \le t) = \int_0^t f(s)ds$

- Survival function: $S(t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F(t)$

- Hazard function: $\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t | T \ge t)}{\Delta t}$

- Cumulative hazard function: $\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(s)ds$

Knowing one is equivalent to knowing the others.

.question[
How might you express the hazard function in terms of the density funciton and
the survival function?
]

### Survival vs. hazard functions:

Survival (or survivor) function:

\begin{align*}
S(t) = P(T > t)
\end{align*}
- Non-increasing with $S(0) = 1$ and $\lim_{t \to \infty} S(t) = 0$
- For any given time $t$, a probability

--

Hazard function:

\begin{align*}
\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t | T \ge t)}{\Delta t}
\end{align*}

- Instantaneous failure rate, *given* already having survived to time $t$
- **Not** a probability (for continuous $T$)
- Non-negative and unbounded for all $t$
- Often more useful interpretations than survival functions
- Nice analytical properties under right-censoring

---

### Estimating the survival curve

The .vocab[Kaplan-Meier estimate] provides an intuitive *non-parametric* 
estimate of the survival curve:

- $D_i$: # who fail at time $t_i$
- $S_i$: # who have survived beyond $t_i$ (includes those who were censored
exactly at $t_i$)
- $N_i$: # at risk of failure at time $t_i$ (i.e., those who did not fail
before $t_i$ and were not censored before $t_i$)

--

The Kaplan-Meier estimate is

\begin{align*}
\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{i:t_i \le t}\left(1 - \frac{D_i}{N_i} \right) = \prod_{i: t_i \le t} \frac{S_i}{N_i}
\end{align*}

---

### Estimating the survival curve

\begin{align*}
\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{i:t_i \le t}\left(1 - \frac{D_i}{N_i} \right) = \prod_{i: t_i \le t} \frac{S_i}{N_i}
\end{align*}

How might we calculate P(survived past $t_1 \cap t_2$)?

--

P(survive past $t_1$)P(survive past $t_2$ | survived past $t_1$)

...and so on. If an observation is censored, it is no longer at risk of failing
at the next failure time and is taken out of the calculation.

---

### Estimating the survival curve

Suppose we had a small study with the following data:

| Patient | Event Time | Event Type | 
| ------- | ---------: | ---------- |
| 1       | 4.5        | Failure    |
| 2       | 7.5        | Failure    |
| 3       | 8.5        | Censoring  |
| 4       | 11.5       | Failure    |
| 5       | 13.5       | Censoring  |
| 6       | 15.5       | Failure    |
| 7       | 16.5       | Failure    |
| 8       | 17.5       | Censoring  |
| 9       | 19.5       | Failure    |
| 10     | 21.5       | Censoring  |

| $t$  | Risk Set | # Failed | # Censored | $\hat{S}(t)$ |
| ---: | -------: | -------: | ---------: | :----------: |
| 0    | 10       | 0        | 0          | $1$          |
| 4.5  | 10       | 1        | 0          | $1 - \frac{1}{10} = 0.9$ |
| 7.5  | 9        | 1        | 0          | $0.9 \times (1 - \frac{1}{9}) = 0.8$ |
| 8.5  | 8        | 0        | 1          | $0.8 \times (1 - \frac{0}{8}) = 0.8$ |

| 13.5 | 6        | 0        | 1          | $0.69 \times (1 - \frac{0}{6}) = 0.69$ |
| 15.5 | 5        | 1        | 0          | $0.69 \times (1 - \frac{1}{5}) = 0.552$ |
| 16.5 | 4        | 1        | 0          | $0.552 \times (1 - \frac{1}{4}) = 0.414$ |
| 17.5 | 3        | 0        | 1          | $0.414 \times (1 - \frac{0}{3}) = 0.414$ |
| 19.5 | 2        | 1        | 0          | $0.414 \times (1 - \frac{1}{2}) = 0.207$ |
| 21.5 | 1        | 0        | 1          | $0.207 \times (1 - \frac{0}{1}) = 0.207$ |

     conf.int = T, censor = F, fun = "event", 
     legend.labs = c("Placebo", "Digoxin"))
```

### Comparing multiple groups

How might we formally test whether there is a difference in the two survival
curves?

\begin{align*}
H_0:& S_1(t) = S_2(t)\\
H_1:& S_1(t) \neq S_2(t)
\end{align*}

---

### Comparing multiple groups

The .vocab[log-rank] test constructs 2-by-2 contingency tables (assuming two
groups) at each time at which a failure occurs. Then, these tables are 
combined using Mantel-Haenszel to evaluate whether there is a differnce in the
two curves:

|         | Group 1 | Group 2 | Total |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- | --- |
| Deaths at $t_i$       | $D_{1i}$        | $D_{2i}$    | $D_i$ |
| Survivors past $t_i$       | $S_{1i}$        | $S_{2i}$    | $S_i$ |
| Total at risk | $N_{1i}$ | $N_{2i}$ | $N_i$ |

comparing observed failures $D_{1i}$ against the expected count under $H_0$.

The test statistic has an asymptotic $\chi^2_1$ distribution under $H_0$ (for
two groups).

---

### Comparing multiple groups

It is most powerful under proportional hazards (check empirically),
and not very powerful at all if survival curves cross. Alternatives
are available in this situation.

The log-rank test can be extended to adjust for a categorical
confounder by considering a stratified version, and can also be
extended to test for differences in survival functions across more
than 2 groups.

### Comparing multiple groups
