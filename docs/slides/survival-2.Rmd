### The DIG Trial

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '120%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dig_trial.png")
```

Investigators compared the **primary outcome** of the number of days from the
start of the study to either death or hospitalization from worsening heart
failure.

### Representing survival data

Underlying data:
- $T$: Failure time, a non-negative random variable
- $C$: Censoring time, a non-negative random variable
Observed data for individual $i$:
- $Y_i$: $(T_i \wedge C_i)$, the minimum of $T_i$ and $C_i$
- $\delta_i$: $1_{(T_i \le C_i)}$, whether we observe a failure

If $\delta_i = 0$, then we have .vocab[right-censoring]: the survival time is
longer than the censoring time.

Commonly, we assume $C_i$ are *i.i.d.* random variables with some distribution
and that the censoring mechanism is *independent* of the failure mechanism.

---

### Characterizing continuous $T$

- Density function: $f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t}$

- Distribution function: $F(t) = P(T \le t) = \int_0^t f(s)ds$

- Survival function: $S(t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F(t)$

- Hazard function: $\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t | T \ge t)}{\Delta t}$

- Cumulative hazard function: $\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(s)ds$

Knowing one is equivalent to knowing the others.

---

### Hazard distributions

Exponential distribution:

- $f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}$ (don't get the rate parameter $\lambda$ 
confused with the hazard)
- $F(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$
- $S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}$
- $\lambda(t) = \lambda$
- $\Lambda(t) = \lambda t$

.question[
What do you notice about the hazard for survival times that have an exponential 
distribution?
]

---

### Hazard distributions

Weibull distribution:

- $f(t) = p\lambda^p t^{p - 1}e^{-(\lambda t)^p}$
- $F(t) = 1 - e^{-(\lambda t)^p}$
- $S(t) = e^{-(\lambda t)^p}$
- $\lambda(t) = p\lambda^p t^{p - 1}$
- $\Lambda(t) = (\lambda t)^p$

When the shape parameter $p$ is 1, then we have the exponential distribution.

The hazard increases monotonically over time if $p > 1$ and decreases 
monotonically if $p < 1$ (is this reasonable to assume?).

---

### Hazard distributions

Plotting Weibull hazard with $\lambda = 1$ and various shape parameters $p$:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
xs <- seq(0, 4, by = 0.002)
y1 <- rep(1, length(xs))
y2 <- 0.5*xs^(0.5-1)
y2 <- 2*xs^(2-1)
y3 <- 0.25*xs^(0.25-1)
y4 <- 4*xs^(4-1)
plot(xs, y1, type = "l", ylim = c(0,4), xlab = "Time", ylab = "Hazard")
lines(xs, y2, col = "red")
lines(xs, y3, col = "blue")
lines(xs, y4, col = "gray")
```

---

### Hazard distributions

Log-normal distribution:

- $f(t) = \frac{1}{t \sigma}\phi\left(\frac{\log(t) - \mu}{\sigma} \right)$
- $F(t) = \Phi\left(\frac{\log(t) - \mu}{\sigma} \right)$
- $S(t) = 1 - F(t)$
- $\lambda(t) = f(t)/S(t)$
- $\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(s)ds$

---

### Hazard distributions

Plotting log-normal hazard with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
xs <- seq(0, 4, by = 0.001)
y1 <- dnorm(log(xs))/((1-pnorm(log(xs)))*xs)
plot(xs, y1, type = "l", ylim = c(0,1), xlab = "Time", ylab = "Hazard")
```

---

### Hazard distributions

Log-logistic distribution:

- $f(t) = \frac{(\beta/\alpha)(t/\alpha)^{\beta - 1}}{(1 + (t/\alpha)^\beta)^2}$
- $F(t) = \frac{(t/\alpha)^\beta}{1 + (t/\alpha)^\beta}$
- $S(t) = \frac{1}{1 + (t/\alpha)^\beta}$
- $\lambda(t) = \frac{(\beta/\alpha)(t/\alpha)^{\beta - 1}}{1 + (t/\alpha)^\beta}$
- $\Lambda(t) = \log(1 + (t/\alpha)^\beta)$

---

### Hazard distributions

Plotting log-logistic hazards with $\alpha = 1$ and various $\beta$:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
xs <- seq(0, 4, by = 0.001)
y1 <- 1*xs^(1 - 1)/(1 + xs)^1
y2 <- 2*xs^(2 - 1)/(1 + xs)^2
y3 <- 4*xs^(4 - 1)/(1 + xs)^4
y4 <- 0.5*xs^(0.5 - 1)/(1 + xs)^0.5 
plot(xs, y1, type = "l", ylim = c(0,1), xlab = "Time", ylab = "Hazard")
lines(xs, y2, type = "l", col = "darkred")
lines(xs, y3, type = "l", col = "blue")
lines(xs, y4, type = "l", col = "gray")
```

---

### Estimation

Suppose we had a series of *non-censored* observations $t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n$, 
and we thought that these survival times were i.i.d. and came from some
distribution with density $f(t)$.

.question[
How might we estimate the parameter(s) $\theta$ of that distribution?
]

---

### Review: maximum likelihood estimation

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\theta | T) &= f(t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n | \theta)\\
&= f(t_1 | \theta)f(t_2 | \theta) \cdots f(t_n | \theta)\\
&= \prod_{i = 1}^n f(t_i|\theta),
\end{align*}

which we can often maximize in closed form for many familiar distributions (or 
numerically). 

---

### Review: maximum likelihood estimation

For instance, if we thought $T \stackrel{i.i.d}{\sim} Exp(\lambda)$, then 

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\lambda | T) &= \lambda^n \exp \left(-\lambda\sum_{i = 1}^n t_n \right)\\
\log \mathcal{L}(\lambda | T) &= n\log(\lambda) - \lambda \sum_{i = 1}^n t_i,\\
\hat{\lambda}_{MLE} &= \frac{n}{\sum_{i = 1}^n t_i}
\end{align*}

---

### Estimation for censored data

How might we perform maximum likelihood estimation for *censored* data? What
would the likelihood look like? Suppose we have $n$ i.i.d. observations with the
same $f(t)$, $S(t)$, and hazard $\lambda(t)$. Consider what might happen at time
$t_i$:

- Case 1: Individual experiences event at $t_i: \delta_i = 1$. In 
this case, they contribute the density at $t_i$, which is $f(t_i)$.

.question[
What would their contribution to the likelihood be if they were censored?
]

--

- Case 2: Individual is still alive at $t_i: \delta_i = 0$. In this
case, we know that their survival time is greater than $t_i$, which happens with
probability $S(t_i)$.

--

So, this individual's contribution to the likelihood is 

\begin{align*}
f(t_i)^{\delta_i}S(t_i)^{1 - \delta_i}
\end{align*}

---

### Estimation for censored data

Note that

\begin{align*}
\lambda(t) &= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t | T \ge t)}{\Delta t}\\
&= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t \cap T \ge t)/P(T \ge t)}{\Delta t}\\
&= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t)}{P(T \ge t)\Delta t}\\
&= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{f(t)\Delta t}{P(T \ge t)\Delta t}\\
&= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}, \\
f(t) &= \lambda(t)S(t)
\end{align*}

---

### Estimation for censored data

An individual's contribution to the likelihood is thus

\begin{align*}
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}} f(t_i)^{\delta_i}S(t_i)^{1 - \delta_i}\\
&= \lambda(t_i)^{\delta_i}S(t_i)^{\delta_i}S(t_i)^{1 - \delta_i}\\
&= \lambda(t_i)^{\delta_i}S(t_i)
\end{align*}

For our exponential example with $T \stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim} Exp(\lambda)$, since
the hazard is given by $\lambda$ and the survival function is given by 
$e^{-\lambda t}$, we would thus have

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\lambda | T) &= \prod_{i = 1}^n \lambda^{\delta_i}\exp(-\lambda t_i),
\end{align*}

which we could then maximize using familiar methods.

---

### Covariates?

.question[
How might we adjust for potential covariates that might be related to our
outcome? Is there any way to create a predictive model for survival time?
]

---

### Some candidate models

Could we use the following model for survival outcomes?

\begin{align*}
T_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i
\end{align*}

--

How about this model?

\begin{align*}
\log(T_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i
\end{align*}

---

### An accelerated failure time model

An .vocab[accelerated failure time] (AFT) model assumes

\begin{align*}
\log(T_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i
\end{align*}

where $\epsilon_i$ are commonly assumed to be i.i.d. and follow some specified
distribution.

.question[
How might we "know" what distribution $\epsilon$ takes on?
]

---

### An accelerated failure time model

\begin{align*}
\log(T_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i
\end{align*}

There is a one-to-one relationship between the distribution of $T$ and the
assumed error distribution in the AFT model. 

For instance, assuming $\epsilon_i$ has a normal distribution implies $T_i$ 
has a log-normal distribution.

---

### An accelerated failure time model

Note that we can also write the AFT model as

\begin{align*}
\log(T_i) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i\\
T_i &= \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} \right)e^{\epsilon_i}
\end{align*}

.question[
How might we interpret coefficients in the AFT model?
]

---

### An accelerated failure time model

\begin{align*}
T_i &= \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} \right)e^{\epsilon_i}\\
&= e^{\beta_0}e^{\beta_1x_{1i}}e^{\beta_2x_{2i}}\cdots e^{\beta_px_{pi}}e^{\epsilon_i}
\end{align*}

Covariates in an AFT model have a multiplicative effect on *time*. 

For instance,
if $\beta_k = 0.4$, then $\exp(\beta_k) \approx 1.5$. Holding all else equal,
an individual with covariate $x_k$ one unit greater than another is expected
to survive approximately 1.5 times longer than the other. The probability that
they have survived to time $1.5t$ is the same as the probability that the other
individual is alive has survived to time $t$.

---

### Estimation in survival models

Remember that an individual's contribution to the likelihood is

\begin{align*}
\lambda(t)^{\delta_i}S(t),
\end{align*}

and so the full likelihood function is given by

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\theta | Y) = \prod_{i = 1}^n \lambda(t_i)^{\delta_i}S(t_i).
\end{align*}

This likelihood function holds regardless of what type of model is being
estimated (for independently right-censored data).

---

### Fitting an AFT model

Recall that our model specifies a functional form between $Y$, $\beta$, and 
$\mathbf{X}$. For the AFT model,

\begin{align*}
\log(T_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i,
\end{align*}

Suppose we think $T$ follows an exponential distribution such that
$T \sim Exp(\exp(\mathbf{X}^T\beta))$; that is, $\epsilon$ has a standard 
extreme value distribution: $f(u) = \exp(u - \exp(u))$.

Then we have:

\begin{align*}
S(t | \mathbf{X}) &= \exp(-t\exp(\mathbf{X}^T\beta))\\
\lambda(t | \mathbf{X}) &= \exp(\mathbf{X}^T\beta)
\end{align*}

---

### Fitting an AFT model

Thus we can maximize the likelihood for this model

\begin{align*}
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}} \prod_{i = 1}^n \lambda(t_i | \mathbf{X}_i)^{\delta_i}S(t_i | \mathbf{X}_i)\\
&= \prod_{i = 1}^n \exp(\mathbf{X}_i^T\beta)^{\delta_i}\exp(-t\exp(\mathbf{X}_i^T\beta))
\end{align*}

with respect to the regression parameters of interest $\beta$. Different 
assumptions re: error distributions (and thus of $T$) result in different hazard 
and survival functions being plugged into our generic likelihood.

Note that there is no closed form for this likelihood function with respect to 
$\beta$; choose your favorite numerical method (we'll see Newton-Raphson once
again in model output on the following slides).

```{r, echo = F}
dig <- dig[complete.cases(dig[c("DWHFDAYS", "DWHF", "TRTMT", "EJF_PER", "PREVMI")]),]
```

---

### Fitting an AFT model

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(survival)
aft_e <- survreg(Surv(DWHFDAYS, DWHF) ~ TRTMT + EJF_PER + PREVMI, 
                 data = dig, dist = "exponential")
summary(aft_e)
```

---

### Fitting an AFT model

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(survival)
aft_w <- survreg(Surv(DWHFDAYS, DWHF) ~ TRTMT + EJF_PER + PREVMI, 
                 data = dig, dist = "weibull")
summary(aft_w)
```

---

### Fitting an AFT model

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(survival)
aft_n <- survreg(Surv(DWHFDAYS, DWHF) ~ TRTMT + EJF_PER + PREVMI, 
                 data = dig, dist = "lognormal")
summary(aft_n)
```

---

### Fitting an AFT model

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(survival)
aft_l <- survreg(Surv(DWHFDAYS, DWHF) ~ TRTMT + EJF_PER + PREVMI, 
                 data = dig, dist = "loglogistic")
summary(aft_l)
```

---

### How well are we fitting?

In each of these past examples, we've assumed a distribution of survival times.
How can we check if we've made an appropriate assumption? Suppose we use the
following residuals:

\begin{align*}
\widehat{e}_i &= \frac{\log(Y_i) - \mathbf{X}_i^T\widehat{\beta}}{\widehat{\phi}}
\end{align*}

where $\phi$ is the scale parameter from the model (don't worry about this).

.question[
What does $\widehat{e}_i$ represent? Is it appropriate to use these in some way?
]

---

### How well are we fitting?

$\widehat{e}_i$ examine scaled differences from $Y_i$, the *observed* data. 
Thus, these are *censored* residuals, which we must take into account. 

One way to deal with this issue is to plot a Kaplan-Meier plot of these 
residuals against the survival function of the assumed distribution.

```{r, eval = F}
resids <- (log(dig$DWHFDAYS) - aft_ll$linear.predictors) / 
  (aft_ll$scale)
m1 <- survfit(Surv(resids, DWHF) ~ 1, data = dig)
plot(m1, xlab = "AFT Residuals (Logistic model)", 
     ylab = "Survival Probability")
exp.x <- seq(min(resids), max(resids), length = 100)
exp.y <- plogis(exp.x, lower.tail = F) # F(t)
lines(exp.x, exp.y, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

---

### How well are we fitting?

```{r, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
resids <- (log(dig$DWHFDAYS) - aft_l$linear.predictors) / 
  (aft_l$scale)

plot(m1, xlab = "AFT Residuals (Logistic model)", 
     ylab = "Survival Probability")
x <- seq(min(resids), max(resids), length = 100)
y <- plogis(x, lower.tail = F) # F(t) for logistic
lines(x, y, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
