### A disclaimer

Today's seminar is an introductory surface level treatment of
mediation analysis. We focus on applications and use cases -- there are no 
theoretical results presented (even for important subjects like variance
estimation). Much of the discussion comes from VanderWeele (2016).

Mediation analysis examines the **process** by which a exposure might "impact"
an outcome - that is, a pathway examining *how* one variable might "influence"
another. We might be able to better understand biological pathways or maybe
provide evidence supporting/refuting a certain theory.

At 3 months in, patients receiving the CBT had higher rates of antidepressant
use. Could this be the driver for the efficacy seen later in the trial?

Might we instead be able to focus on pharmacological management rather than costly 
one-on-one sessions with trained therapists?

### Brief detour: causal interpretation

We can interpret mediation analysis in the potential outcomes framework 
(Robins and Greenland, 1992; Pearl, 2001; VanderWeele, 2015):

- $M_{X = x}$: the value of $M$ if $X$ were (perhaps counter to fact) equal to $x$
- $Y_{X = x, M = m}$: the value of $Y$ that would have occurred if $X = x$ and
$M = x$
- $Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x}}$: nested counterfactual of the value of $Y$ if
$X = x$ and $M$ took on its own counterfactual value if $X = x$.

--

The .vocab[total causal effect] (TCE) comparing two levels of the exposure
$X = x$ to $X = x^\star$ is:

\begin{align*}
TCE = Y_{X = x} - Y_{X = x^\star}
\end{align*}

---

### Brief detour: causal interpretation

The TCE may be decomposed as follows:

\begin{align*}
Y_{X = x} - Y(X = ^\star) &= Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x}} - Y_{X = x^\star, M = M_{X = x^\star}}\\
&= \underbrace{\left(Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x^\star}} - Y_{X = x^\star, M = M_{X = x^\star}}\right)}_{NDE} + \\
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}}\underbrace{\left(Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x}} - Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x^\star}}\right)}_{NIE}. 
\end{align*}

The .vocab[natural direct effect] (NDE) represents the difference between two
potential outcomes differing in the counterfactual value of the exposure, but 
where the value of the mediator is held constant at its counterfactual value 
when $X = x^\star$ for both. The direct effect represents all causal effects of 
the exposure on the outcome *not* carried through the mediator.

### Brief detour: causal interpretation

The TCE may be decomposed as follows:

\begin{align*}
Y_{X = x} - Y(X = ^\star) &= Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x}} - Y_{X = x^\star, M = M_{X = x^\star}}\\
&= \underbrace{\left(Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x^\star}} - Y_{X = x^\star, M = M_{X = x^\star}}\right)}_{NDE} + \\
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}}\underbrace{\left(Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x}} - Y_{X = x, M = M_{X = x^\star}}\right)}_{NIE}. 
\end{align*}

The .vocab[natural indirect effect] (NIE) represents the difference between two
potential outcomes: one in which the mediator takes on its potential outcome 
under $X = x$, and one in which the mediator takes on its potential outcome if 
instead $X$ were equal to $x^\star$, but where the exposure is held constant at 
$X = x$ for both.  

--

The .vocab[average causal mediation effect] (ACME) is the expectation (in the
mathematical sense) of the NIE.

### The classical "four steps" 

```{r, echo = F}
dat <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Yue\\Projects\\Dissertation\\data\\pheno.csv")
set.seed(1234)
dat$cg05575921 <- dat$cg05575921 + rnorm(2268, 0, 0.01)
dat$packyears[dat$packyears > 0] <- round(dat$packyears[dat$packyears > 0] + rexp(760, 3), 1)
dat$smoke <- ifelse(dat$smok123 == 1, 0, 1)
dat$fev1 <- dat$fev1 + round(rnorm(2268, 0, 20))
dat <- dat[sample(1:2268, 802),]
dat$smokecat <- ifelse(dat$smoke == 1, "Has smoked", "Never-smoker")
```

For the sake of illustration, let's use some simulated data intended to 
represent the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort of pesticide 
applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning = F, message = F, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("img/ahs.png")
```

---

### The total effect model

```{r, echo = F, dpi = 300}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = fev1)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue", color = "darkblue", binwidth = 250) +
  facet_grid(smokecat~.) + 
  labs(y = "Count", x = "FEV1 (mL)",
       title = "Smoking associated with lower lung function",
       subtitle = "p = 0.031") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

---

### The total effect model

```{r}
tot.mod <- lm(fev1 ~ smokecat, data = dat)
summary(tot.mod)
```

---

### The mediator model

```{r, echo = F, dpi = 300}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = cg05575921)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue", color = "darkblue", binwidth = 0.01) +
  facet_grid(smokecat~.) + 
  labs(y = "Count", x = "Methylation at cg05575921 (M values)",
       title = "Differential methylation among smokers",
       subtitle = "t-test; p < 0.001") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

---

### The mediator model

```{r}
med.mod <- lm(cg05575921 ~ smokecat, data = dat)
summary(med.mod)
```

---

### The outcome model

```{r, echo = F, dpi = 300}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = cg05575921, y = fev1, color = smokecat)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.35) + 
  labs(y = "FEV1 (mL)", x = "Methylation at cg05575921 (M value)",
       color = "Smoking status") +
       theme_minimal()
```

---

### The outcome model

```{r}
out.mod <- lm(fev1 ~ smokecat + cg05575921, data = dat)
summary(out.mod)
```

---

### Specifying a causal model

```{r, message = F, warning = F, cache = T}
library(mediation)
med <- mediate(med.mod, out.mod, 
               treat = "smokecat",
               mediator = "cg05575921",
               boot = T, sims = 500)
summary(med)
```

---

### Assumptions for model-based causal mediation

Some (pretty strong) necessary assumptions needed for causal interpretations of 
mediation include the following:

1. Strong ignorability of treatment: $\left\{Y_{X = x^\star, M = m}, M_{X = x} \right\} \perp X | Z = z$
2. *Sequential* ignorability for mediators: $Y_{X = x^\star, M = m} \perp M_{X = x} | X = x, Z = z$

What do these actually mean?

---

### Assumptions for model-based causal mediation

We can't have

1. Confounding between the .vocab[exposure] and .vocab[outcome]
2. Confounding between the .vocab[exposure] and .vocab[mediator]
3. Confounding between the .vocab[mediator] and .vocab[outcome]
4. Confounding between the .vocab[mediator] and .vocab[outcome] *itself*
affected by the .vocab[exposure].

--

Ideally, these assumptions would be dealt with when *designing* your study.

--

Randomization might take care of (1) and (2), but (3) and (4) are a bit 
trickier to deal with. Essentially, (3) and (4) require that no post-exposure
confounders exist *and* that no unmeasured pre-treatment confounders exist
(unfortunately, this is basically untestable).

--

Why are these assumptions needed?

### Assumptions for model-based causal mediation

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning = F, message = F, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("img/med7.png")
```

A naive mediation analysis of the data gives an NDE estimate of -0.37, an NIE
of 0.03, and suggests that antidepressant use increases depression (????).

              data = dat)
out.mod <- glm(asthma ~ smokecat + cg05575921 + gender + age, 
               family = "binomial",
               data = dat)
