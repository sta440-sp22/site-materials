### The DIG Trial

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '120%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dig_trial.png")
```

Investigators compared the **primary outcome** of the number of days from the
start of the study to either death or hospitalization from worsening heart
failure.

### Review: accelerated failure time model

An .vocab[accelerated failure time] (AFT) model assumes

\begin{align*}
\log(T_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_px_p + \epsilon_i
\end{align*}

where $\epsilon_i$ are commonly assumed to be i.i.d. and follow some specified
distribution.

Covariates in an AFT model have a multiplicative effect on *time*. For instance,
if $\beta_k = 0.4$, then $\exp(\beta_k) \approx 1.5$. Holding all else equal,
an individual with covariate $x_k$ one unit greater than another is expected
to survive approximately 1.5 times longer than the other.

### Fitting an AFT model

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(survival)
aft_w <- survreg(Surv(DWHFDAYS, DWHF) ~ TRTMT + EJF_PER + PREVMI, 
                 data = dig, dist = "lognormal")
summary(aft_w)
```

### Visualizing the AFT model

```{r, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
x <- seq(0, 50, 0.01)
y <- pnorm((log(x) - 2)/0.75)
plot(x, 1 - y, type = "l", ylim = c(0, 1), xlim = c(0, 20),
     xlab = "Time", ylab = "Survival",
     main = "Survival functions for various log-normal failure times")
lines(x*0.5, (1 - y), col = "darkred")
lines(x*2, (1 - y), col = "deepskyblue")
lines(x, 1 - y, col = "black")
text(10, 0.42, expression(S[0](t)))
text(10, 0.17, expression(S[1](t)))
text(10, 0.78, expression(S[2](t)))
```

### A similar model for hazards?

```{r, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
y <- dnorm((log(x) - 2)/0.75)/((1-pnorm((log(x) - 2)/0.75))*x*0.75)
plot(x, y, type = "l", xlim = c(0, 20), ylim = c(0, 0.4),
     xlab = "Time", ylab = "Hazard",
     main = "Hazard functions for various log-normal failure times")
lines(x, 0.5*y, col = "deepskyblue")
lines(x, 2*y, col = "darkred")
text(10, 0.165, expression(lambda[0](t)))
text(10, 0.09, expression(lambda[2](t)))
text(10, 0.305, expression(lambda[1](t)))
```

### A proportional hazards model

\begin{align*}
\lambda(t) &= \lambda_0(t)\exp\left(\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_px_p \right)
\end{align*}

where $\lambda_0$ is the .vocab[baseline hazard], which describes the hazard
function for an individual with $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{0}$.

A .vocab[proportional hazards] model is a linear model for the log hazard ratio.

.question[
How might we interpret $\beta$ terms in such a model? Why is there no intercept
term $\beta_0$?

### A proportional hazards model

\begin{align*}
\lambda(t) &= \lambda_0(t)\exp\left(\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_px_p \right)
\end{align*}

Covariates in a PH model have a multiplicative effect on *hazards*. For
instance, if $\beta_k = 0.4$, then $\exp(\beta_k) \approx 1.5$. Holding all else 
equal, an individual with covariate $x_k$ one unit greater than another is 
expected to have approximately 1.5 times the *hazard* of the event than the
other. This multiplicative effect holds *regardless* of the time $t$.

.question[
Would you rather have a higher linear predictor or a lower linear predictor
in a PH model? How does this compare to the AFT model?

### The Cox proportional hazards model

\begin{align*}
\lambda(t) &= \lambda_0(t)\exp\left(\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_px_p \right)
\end{align*}

In a parametric survival model (such as ones we've seen), the survival times
are assumed to follow a specific distribution, which might be a strong
assumption.

--

Often times, we only care about the $\beta$ terms and not so much the 
$\lambda_0$. Using the concept of partial likelihood, Cox (1972) found that we 
can "separate" inference for the $\beta$ terms from $\lambda_0$. 

The Cox model is a *semiparametric* survival model; $\lambda_0(t)$ (*infinite*-
dimensional) is left completely unspecified, with no assumptions made on its 
shape. (A semi-parametric version of the AFT model also exists, but isn't very 
popular for reasons we won't get into).

---

### Estimating $\beta$s

.question[
How can we estimate $\beta$ parameters if $\lambda_0(t)$ is infinite-dimensional?
]

---

### Estimating $\beta$s

For now, assume that there are no tied failure times. Suppose we know that there
is one failure at time $t_j$. For this failure time, the contribution to the
"likelihood" is the probability that individual $j$ fails, *given* that there is exactly one failure in the risk set at that time:

\begin{align*}
P(\text{individual }j\text{ fails} | \text{one failure from }\mathcal{R}(t_j))
\end{align*}

where $\mathcal{R}(t_j) = \left\{i: T_i \ge t_j \right\}$ is the risk set at time
$t_j$.

---

### Estimating $\beta$s

Note that the probability 

\begin{align*}
P(\text{individual }j\text{ fails} | \text{one failure from }\mathcal{R}(t_j))
\end{align*}

conditions on exactly one failure at time $t_j$; we don't know who it is! This
is equivalent to the probability

\begin{align*}
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}} \frac{P(\text{individual }j\text{ fails} | \text{at risk at }t_j)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{R}(t_j)}P(\text{individual }k\text{ fails} | \text{at risk at }t_j)}\\
&= \frac{\lambda(t_j | \mathbf{X}_j)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{R}(t_j)}\lambda(t_j | \mathbf{X}_k)}
\end{align*}

---

### Estimating $\beta$s

Under proportional hazards,
$\lambda(t | \mathbf{X}) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\mathbf{X}^T\beta)$. Thus, for each
failure time $t_j$, we have 

\begin{align*}
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}} \frac{\lambda(t_j | \mathbf{X}_j)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{R}(t_j)}\lambda(t_j | \mathbf{X}_k)}\\
&= \frac{\lambda_0(t_j)\exp(\mathbf{X}_j^T\beta)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{R}(t_j)}\lambda_0(t_j)\exp(\mathbf{X}_k^T\beta)}\\
&= \frac{\exp(\mathbf{X}_j^T\beta)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{R}(t_j)}\exp(\mathbf{X}_k^T\beta)}
\end{align*}

---

### Estimating $\beta$s

If there are $J$ total failure times, the "likelihood" is thus the product over
all possible failure times: 

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}^\star(\beta | \mathbf{X}) &= \prod_{j = 1}^J \frac{\exp(\mathbf{X}_j^T\beta)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{R}(t_j)}\exp(\mathbf{X}_k^T\beta)}
\end{align*}

Note that we can maximize this quantity with respect to $\beta$ terms *without* 
having to estimate (or even specify) the baseline hazard $\lambda_0(t)$!

---

### The Cox proportional hazards model

\begin{align*}
\lambda(t) &= \lambda_0(t)\exp\left(\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_px_p \right)
\end{align*}

- Fewer assumptions than fully parametric models, but still requires PH 
assumption
- By far the most commonly used regression model for survival data
- Attractive interpretations using hazard ratios
- Can be extended to accommodate time-varying covariates, recurrent events, etc.

### Fitting the Cox PH model

```{r}
coxm1 <- coxph(Surv(DWHFDAYS, DWHF) ~ TRTMT + EJF_PER + PREVMI, 
                    data = dig)
summary(coxm1)
```

.question[
How might we interpret these coefficients? How do they compare to our previous
models?
]

---

### Fitting the Cox PH model

One strength of the Cox model is that we can ignore estimation of $\lambda_0$
completely (it doesn't matter for valid inference on the $\beta$s).

If we want to estimate survival probabilities, then we must estimate the 
baseline hazard. A non-parametric estimate of the cumulative hazard (the 
.vocab[Breslow estimator]) is implemented by the `basehaz` function in the 
`survival` package by:

\begin{align*}
\hat{\Lambda}_0(t) = \sum_{i:t_{(i)} < t} \frac{1}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{R}_i} \exp(\mathbf{X}_k\beta)}
\end{align*}

We can then estimate survival in the Cox model by:

\begin{align*}
\hat{S}(t|\mathbf{X}) = \exp(-\exp(\mathbf{X}\beta) \hat{\Lambda}_0(t))
\end{align*}

### Cox model diagnostics

Recall the inverse CDF result: if $T_i$ has survival function $S_i(t)$, then
$S_i(T_i)$ should have a uniform distribution on (0, 1) and $\Lambda_i(T_i)$
should follow Exp(1) distribution.

Thus, if the model is correct, then the estimated cumulative hazard $\hat{\Lambda}$
at observed times should be a censored sample from Exp(1). These $\hat{\Lambda}_i(Y_i)$
are known as .vocab[Cox-Snell residuals].

--

Plotting $\log(-\log\hat{S}(Y_i))$ against $\log(Y_i)$ should thus follow a 
straight line through the origin at a 45-degree angle. 

Although Cox-Snell residuals can also be used for other models (e.g., checking
whether distribution specified in AFT model is appropriate), they're not too
useful in practice (for a variety of reasons).

---

### Cox model diagnostics

To assess PH assumption, we can examine .vocab[Schoenfeld residuals]. 
Intuitively, each Schoenfeld residual is the difference between the observed
covariate and the expected covariate for each observed failure, conditioned on
the risk set at that time.

In plotting Schoenfeld residuals vs. survival times, we expect to see them
randomly distributed around 0.

---

### Cox model diagnostics

.vocab[Martingale residuals] are based on the difference between observed number 
of events up until time $Y_i$ and the expected count based on the fitted model.

.vocab[Deviance residuals] are a normalized transformation of the martingale
residuals that correct their skewness. They should be randomly distributed 
around mean 0 with a variance of 1.

In practice, these residuals are useful for finding potential outliers: negative
values "lived longer than expected" and positive values "died too soon."
