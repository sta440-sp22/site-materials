### Ordinal data

In this case, our outcome is *ordered* (and categorical). Although we have 
"numbers" on a pain scale from 0 to 10, these numbers don't have a linear
relationship - a 4 isn't necessarily twice as painful as a 4; a 3 isn't three
times as painful as 1.

However, these data *are* ordered. We do know that a 4 is more painful than a 3,
which is more painful than a 2, etc. 

.question[
What are some potential pitfalls of using an ordinary least squares regression?
How about using a multinomial regression approach?
]

### A cumulative link model

We might consider an outcome $Y$ that looks at the *cumulative* distribution. For
$j$ total ordered categories, we might model the cumulative probability for
observation $i$:

\begin{align*}
\gamma_{ij} &= P(Y_i \le j)\\
&= P(Y_i = 1) + P(Y_i = 2) + \cdots + P(Y_i = j).
\end{align*}

Note that $\gamma_{ij}$ is limited to values from 0 to 1, as it is a probability.
We might consider a model

\begin{align*}
g(\gamma_{ij}) = \theta_j + X_i^T\beta,
\end{align*}

where $g()$ is a link function mapping 0 to 1 to $\mathbb{R}$.

.question[
What are the $\theta$ terms? What might each $X_i$ look like?
]

---

### A cumulative link model

The $\theta$ terms are constants representing the "baseline" value for each
category (on the transformed scale). This implies that the design matrix will
**not** contain an intercept term (and so that $\beta$s only correspond to
observed covariates).

\begin{align*}
g(\gamma_{ij}) = \theta_j + X_i^T\beta
\end{align*}

.question[
What is the interpretation of $\beta$? What are we implicitly assuming?
]

---

### A cumulative link model

In this case, we have the same covariate effects $\beta$ across **all** of the
categories. This means that $\beta_k$ is the conditional change in (transformed)
cumulative probabilities given a 1 unit difference in $X_{ik}$.

---

### Ordered logistic regression

The ordered logistic regression model is a cumulative link model that assumes a
logit transformation of the cumulative probabilities:

\begin{align*}
logit(\gamma_{ij}) &= \theta_j + X_i^T\beta\\
log\left(\frac{\gamma_{ij}}{1 - \gamma_{ij}}\right) &= \theta_j + X_i^T\beta\\
log\left(\frac{P(Y_i \le j)}{P(Y_i > j)}\right) &= \theta_j + X_i^T\beta\\
\end{align*}

Exponentiating, we have

\begin{align*}
\frac{P(Y_i \le j)}{P(Y_i > j)} &= \exp(\theta_j)\exp(X_i^T\beta)
\end{align*}

.question[
What is the outcome here? How might we interpret $\exp(\theta_j)$? How might
we interpret the $\beta$ terms here?
]

---

### The proportional odds assumption

Remember that we have only one $\beta$ term for each predictor across *all*
categories. This implies that changes in $X_k$ have the same conditional 
relationship with odds of being in category 1 vs. 2, 6 vs. 7, or any $j-1$ vs.
$j$. 

.question[
When might this be a reasonable assumption? When might this assumption be
violated? How might we modify the model in the case that this assumption does
not hold? How might we gut-check this assumption using the data?
]

### Fitting an ordinal logistic model

Note that \texttt{R} calculates 

\begin{align*}
logit(\gamma_{ij}) &= \theta_j - X_{i1}\eta_1 - \cdots - X_{ip}\eta_p
\end{align*}

with $\eta_k = -\beta_k$.

### Fitting an ordinal logistic model

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(MASS)
m1 <- polr(factor(postOp4hour_throatPain) ~ treat + preOp_calcBMI, data = dat)
summary(m1)
```

---

### Fitting an ordinal logistic model

```{r}
exp(coef(m1))
```

.question[
How might we interpret the $\exp(\eta)$ term corresponding to treatment?
]

---

### Fitting an ordinal logistic model

```{r}
exp(coef(m1))
```

Patients who receive licorice treatment have approximately 1/3 the
odds of having the next higher pain category (e.g., 6 vs. 5, or 2 vs. 1, etc.)
compared to patients receiving placebo, while controlling for BMI.

For every $kg/m^2$ increase in BMI, the odds of being in the next higher pain
category is multiplied by approx. 1.02, while controlling for treatment.

```

### Other link functions

Remember, $g()$ can be any function taking probabilities to the real line. 
Depending on how the data "look," we may choose a different link function. For
instance, a negative log-log link $g(Y) = -\log(-\log(Y))$ might fit better
when the probability of "lower" categories is higher, or a complementary log-log
link $g(Y) = \log(-\log(1 - Y))$ when "higher" categories are more likely.

Keep in mind that this affects the relationship between $\beta$ and $\gamma$s;
these types of link functions don't have the "nice" odds-based interpretations
as does the logit link!

For a full list of commonly used link functions, check the documentation for the
`polr` package.
