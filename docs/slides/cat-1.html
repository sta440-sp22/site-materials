### Pneumococcal disease

The World Health Organization estimates that in developing countries 814,000 children under the age of five die annually from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), with an estimated 1.6 million deaths affecting all ages globally.

Several recent studies have identified associations between pneumococcal serotypes (species variations) and patient outcomes from IPD.  We consider data from a study of pneumococcal serotypes and mortality (Inverarity et al. (2011)).

### Pneumococcal disease



|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | 37     | 7     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | 24     | 10    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

.question[
Is there an association between serotype and mortality?
]

---

### Chi-square tests

`\(H_0\)`: There is no association between serotype and mortality
`\(H_1\)`: There is an association between serotype and mortality

Under `\(H_0\)`, we have independence between serotype and mortality, implying that
joint probabilities should be equal to products of marginal distributions:

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | ?     | ?     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | ?     | ?     | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

.question[
What counts might we expect under `\(H_0\)`?
]

---

### Chi-square tests

The .vocab[chi-square test] compares the observed frequencies in each cell to 
the expected count under `\(H_0\)`; if the total differences are large enough, we
reject `\(H_0\)`:

$$
\chi^2 =\sum_{i=1}^{r\times c} \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i},
$$

which has a `\(\chi^2_{(r-1) \times (c-1)}\)` distribution (under `\(H_0\)`).

## 
## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction
## 
## data:  ipd2x2$Serotype and ipd2x2$Status
## X-squared = 1.3359, df = 1, p-value = 0.2478
```

.question[
What might we conclude?
]

---

### Fisher's exact test

The chi-square test relies on asymptotic results, which might not be appropriate
if we have small cell counts (common rules of thumb are &gt;5 or &gt;10 observed in
each cell). .vocab[Fisher's exact test] calculates an exact p-value under a
specific distributional assumption. 

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | 37     | 7     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | 24     | 10    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

---

### Fisher's exact test

Fisher's exact test relies on the .vocab[hypergeometric distribution]. 

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | a     | b     | a+b    |
| Serotype 31   | c     | d    | c+d    |
| **Total**       | a+c    | b+d    | a+b+c+d   |

Conditionally on the margins (assumed fixed), then each of the individual cells
is distributed according to the hypergeometric distribution. We can thus 
calculate the exact probabilities of obtaining specific *tables*. 

---

### Fisher's exact test

Observed data:

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | 37     | 7     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | 24     | 10    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

We could use the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the probability of
seeing this table, assuming 61 total alive patients, 17 dead, and 44 and 34 
infections of serotypes 10 and 31, respectively (lots of
factorials, so you could imagine it wasn't fun before modern computers).

---

### Fisher's exact test

Another "possible" table:

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | *36*     | *8*     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | *25*     | *9*    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

Here we've displayed another table with the same margins, but with some slightly
different potential cell counts. Again we could use the hypergeometric 
distribution to calculate the probability of observing the cell counts 
conditionally on fixed margins.

---

### Fisher's exact test

Fisher's exact test relies on constructing *all possible* contingency tables
with the same margins, and then summing up probabilities of all tables as 
extreme or more extreme than the observed data.

.question[
What might "more extreme" mean in the context of contingency tables?
]

### Fisher's exact test


```r
fisher.test(ipd2x2$Serotype, ipd2x2$Status)
```

```
## 
## 	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data
## 
## data:  ipd2x2$Serotype and ipd2x2$Status
## p-value = 0.1758
## alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.6465347 7.7636744
## sample estimates:
## odds ratio 
##   2.179552
```

.question[
What might we conclude?
]

---

### Odds ratios

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | 37     | 7     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | 24     | 10    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

Odds of death among serotype 10 patients = `\(\frac{7/44}{37/44} = 7/37\)`

Odds of death among serotype 31 patients = `\(\frac{10/34}{24/34} = 10/24\)`

.vocab[Odds ratio] of death comparing 31 to 10 is thus `\(\frac{10/24}{7/37} \approx 2.2\)`

---

### Odds ratios

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | 37     | 7     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | 24     | 10    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

The standard error of the log-odds ratio is given by the square root of the sum 
of the reciprocals of the cell counts. In this case, we would have:

$$
SE(log(OR)) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{37} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{10}} \approx 0.558.
$$

---

### Odds ratios

|               | Alive  | Dead  | Total |
| ------------- | -----: | -----:| ----: |
| Serotype 10   | 37     | 7     | 44    |
| Serotype 31   | 24     | 10    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 61    | 17    | 78   |

A 95% CI for the odds ratio might thus be given by:

`\begin{align*}
\left\{e^{log(OR) - z^\star\times SE(log(OR))},  e^{log(OR) + z^\star\times SE(log(OR))}\right\}
\end{align*}`

.question[
In constructing this OR and CI by hand, do your estimates match those provided
by the `fisher.test()` function?
]

| Serotype 15   | 60     | 12    | 72    |
| Serotype 20   | 97     | 9     | 106   | 
| Serotype 31   | 24     | 10    | 34    |
| **Total**       | 218    | 38    | 256   |

Suppose we were interested in whether a particular training regimen was
associated with "success" as measured by whether an athlete qualified
for being on the US Winter Olympic Team for giant slalom.

### Paired data in 2x2 tables

In the real world, we often see paired data, such as matched case-control
studies or pre/post test designs. The use of pairing often allows us to obtain
higher power and account for within-pair heterogeneity. If the outcome that
we're interested is a proportion, we can use .vocab[McNemar's test] to 
evaluate association.

In such an analysis, we would restructure the contingency table to display
data for the matched pairs.

---

### Winter Olympics training

Perhaps each athlete's GS time was recorded under both the old regimen and the 
new regimen.

|                             | Old; Qualified  | Old; DNQ  |
| -------------               | -----: | -----:| 
| New; Qualified       | a     | b     | 
| New; DNQ | c     | d    | 
                    
The cells along the diagonal (a and d) are called .vocab[concordant] - they
have the same "outcome" across each condition (regimen). The cells on the off-
diagonal (b and c) are called .vocab[discordant] - they depict data for 
pairs that have a difference based on the condition.

---

### McNemar's Test

|                             | Old; Qualified  | Old; DNQ  |
| -------------               | -----: | -----:| 
| New; Qualified       | a     | b     | 
| New; DNQ | c     | d    | 

.vocab[McNemar's Test] examines relative differences in the discordant pairs,
looking for "imbalances" in the way they are distributed; information from
concordant pairs are discarded. Specifically, the test statistic is given by
the squared difference in the number of discordant pairs divided by the total
sum of them, and has a `\(\chi^2_1\)` distribution under `\(H_0\)`:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(b - c)^2}{b + c}
$$

.question[
What do you expect `\((b - c)^2\)` to be under `\(H_0\)`?

### Pregnancy, HIV, and AIDS

Researchers are interested in the special population of `\(HIV+\)` women on 
antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. They would like to know whether in 
this population, a new pregnancy is related to the probability of having an 
AIDS-defining event (that is, their HIV being classified as AIDS).

To test for an association, they recruit women from a large network of health
care clinics and find the following:

|                   | AIDS  | No AIDS  |
| -------------     | -----: | -----:| 
| Pregnant       | 31     |  44  | 
| Not Pregnant       | 124     |  99  | 

.question[
Calculate an odds ratio and associated 95% CI using these data for AIDS-defining
events based on pregnancy status. What might you conclude?
]

---

### Pregnancy, HIV, and AIDS

Consider the following data, which is for all HIV+ women in the area, not just
those who visited a clinic:

|                   | AIDS  | No AIDS  |
| -------------     | -----: | -----:| 
| Pregnant       | 44     |  175  | 
| Not Pregnant       | 248     |  990  | 

.question[
Calculate the same odds ratio as before and associated 95% CI using these data.
What might you conclude? How might you explain this?
]

---

### Pregnancy, HIV, and AIDS

The original sample was collected due to easier data collection (the women are
already in the clinic). However, this is problematic since not all HIV+ women 
are equally likely to visit a health clinic - we have a .vocab[sampling bias]
here:

|                   | Visited clinic  | Did not visit clinic  |
| -------------     | -----: | -----:| 
| Pregnant + AIDS      | 31     |  13  | 
| Pregnant only       | 44     |  131  | 
| AIDS only         | 124 | 124 |
| Neither          | 99 | 891 |

---

### Everyone's heard of Simpson's paradox...

The previous example is an example of .vocab[Berkson's paradox]. In these cases,
two *marginally* independent events become *dependent* conditionally on the
occurrence of either one of the two events. That is, for two independent events,
if we only consider the cases where either of the events occur, then they 
become dependent (usually negatively). 

Note that

`\begin{align*}
P(A) &amp;= \frac{P(A | A \cup B)}{P(A \cup B)}\\
&amp;\le P(A | A \cup B) \times 1\\
&amp;= P(A | A \cup B)
\end{align*}`

---

### Berkson's paradox

HIV+ women can go to the clinic to check on their pregnancy or because they are 
experiencing a drastic lowering in health status. In our original case, we've
*excluded* every woman who was neither pregnant nor particularly worried about 
their HIV. We've conditioned on AIDS-defining event OR pregnancy when sampling
these women. 

A non-pregnant HIV+ woman who went to the clinic is more likely to have AIDS
than HIV+ women in general, because she's specifically going to the clinic for
a *non*-pregnancy-related reason (maybe AIDS). This is responsible for the 
spurious observed conclusion of pregnant HIV+ women having lower AIDS risk than
non-pregnant HIV+ women.
