# Introduction

The dataset `got.csv` contains data as compiled by Rakesh Chintha, inspired by
[Lystad and Brown, 2018](https://injepijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40621-018-0174-7).

The following variables will be used:

- `duration_in_episodes`: the number of episodes the character has made it to 
"so-far" through the end of Season 7 (we're ignoring Season 8 because it's hot
trash)
- `is_dead`: whether the character is dead
- `character_name`: character name
- `royal`: whether the character is a royal
- `house`: which great house of Westeros the character belongs to (if any)
- `gender`: gender of the character

# Lab objective

Explore the data! Can you create a useful visualization that summarizes some
aspects of the time-to-death in this dataset? Does there appear to be evidence
of differential survival depending on certain characteristics (gender, royalty
status, etc.)? What about potential confounders?
