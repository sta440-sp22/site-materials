**Labs in STA440 are not graded and they do not count for credit or points.** 
With that said, please do submit your code/attempt to Gradescope at some point 
before next week's class - I'll provide some brief comments. 

**You may submit this assignment either individually or with your team.**

# Introduction

The dataset `bikecrash.csv` in the GitHub repository contains data from the 
North Carolina Department of Transportation. Each year, about 1,000 bicyclists 
are involved in police-reported crashes with motor vehicles in North Carolina, 
with 60 serious injuries and 20 deaths. This is a tragic yet preventable public 
health issue. Todayâ€™s dataset is contains all police-reported bicycle crashes 
involving a motor vehicle in North Carolina from 2007 through 2014. 

# Lab objective

You will be reviewing best practices for data visualization, as well as some
basic data manipulation tasks in R. You will also review fitting (generalized)
linear models in R.

1. Create a table that depicts the number of bike crashes by county. Does it 
appear to match what is displayed in the slides?

2. Among crashes that occurred when some form of traffic control was present,
what was the most common traffic control during urban crashes? Did this differ
from rural crashes?

3. Create a visualization that depicts the hour at which crashes occur, 
based on injury status. Make sure your graph is well-labeled, clean, and has
a meaningful title. What do you notice? 

4. Create a visualization that depicts the relationship between the biker's age,
the driver's age, and the estimated speed of the driver. What do you notice?

5. Is there evidence of an association between whether an ambulance is required
at the scene and whether the bike crash was a hit and run? Explain using an
appropriate statistical model and quantify any variability in your estimates. 
In your analysis, be sure to account for potential confounding variables, 
including the speed at which the driver was going.
