**Labs in STA440 are not graded and they do not count for credit or points.** 
With that said, please do submit your code/attempt to Gradescope at some point 
before next week's class - I'll provide some brief comments. 

**You may submit this assignment either individually or with your team.**

# Introduction

The dataset `bikecrash_agg.csv` in the GitHub repository contains data from the 
North Carolina Department of Transportation. Each year, about 1,000 bicyclists 
are involved in police-reported crashes with motor vehicles in North Carolina, 
with 60 serious injuries and 20 deaths. This is a tragic yet preventable public 
health issue. Todayâ€™s dataset contains all police-reported bicycle crashes 
involving a motor vehicle in North Carolina from 2007 through 2014, aggregated
at a county level, and also contains characteristics of each of these counties.

The following variables will be used:

- `crashes`: number of crashes in the county
- `pop`: the county population
- `traffic_vol`: mean traffic volume per meter of major roadways
- `pct_rural`: percentage of county population living in rural area

# Lab objective

**For this lab, you must use a Bayesian regression approach** (choose your
favorite!)

Denote counties with over 60 crashes per 100,000 residents per year to be 
"high-crash" counties. Is there evidence of an association between rurality and 
being a high-crash county, after adjusting for population? Explain, and 
quantify any variability in your estimates. Be sure to evaluate model 
convergence.

# Hints

Some general considerations:

- What model might be an appropriate choice?
- What priors might make sense for your parameters of interest?
- How will you evaluate whether your model has converged?
- How will you *answer the question*? Be sure to be clear in your communication.
