# Project objectives

The purpose of the open-ended individual project is for you to use your
statistical toolkit to address an outstanding research project in a principled,
reproducible way. Using a dataset of your choosing, identify an interesting
hypothesis, identify appropriate statistical methods, carry out your analysis,
and present your results in a reproducible report and oral presentation in a
way that is accessible to allied researchers.

<b>Detailed instructions are available in the course 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sta440-sp22)</b>. 

# Learning objectives

**Case-specific goals:**

- Design an appropriate statistical analysis from scratch
- Write and develop a statistically sound analysis plan
- Gain independence as a practicing statistician to tackle an open-ended 
research question of your choice

**Overall class goals:**

- Solidify skills in reproducible research and programming, including 
version-control and collaboration via GitHub
- Critically think about reasonable analysis approaches in the context of 
real-world data
- Express statistical models clearly and correctly
- Develop scientific writing skills by providing clear, concise, data-driven 
conclusions suitable for allied researchers

# Project timeline

- Proposal (optional)
  - Due Friday, February 18
- Initial draft (optional)
  - Due Friday, April 1
- Final manuscript **no grace period**
  - Due Wednesday, April 27
  
The proposal and initial draft are *optional*. However, I highly encourage you
to turn in assignments, as you will receive detailed feedback from the 
instructor. 

Note that there is **no grace period** for the final manuscript - this is because
the individual project serves as this course's final exam and is on the
university final exam schedule. Please use your time wisely!
  
**Note**: your GitHub report repository and commit history will also be
evaluated by the instructor. The GitHub repository must contain the reproducible
R Markdown document corresponding to the submitted reports, and will be checked
throughout the course of the case study.
